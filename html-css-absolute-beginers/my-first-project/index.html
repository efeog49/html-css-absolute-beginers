        <h2>What is Bouldering?</h2>

        <p>
          Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that is performed on small rock
          formations or artificial rock walls without the use of ropes or
          harnesses.
        </p>

        <p>
          Unlike <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_climbing" target="_blank">traditional climbing,</a> bouldering focuses on
          short but intensive routes called "problems," typically keeping
          climbers within a safe distance from the ground while they navigate
          challenging sequences of moves.
        </p>

        <p>
          Experience the
          <strong>perfect blend of physical challenge and mental puzzle-solving</strong>
          as you navigate routes close to the ground, with nothing but a crash
          pad and determination. Bouldering strips climbing down to its purest
          form, making it both
          <strong>accessible to beginners and endlessly challenging for experts.</strong>
